# Excercises

1. Consider the problem from Lecture 3 consisting of a (relatively) simple 2-dimensional mixture model of Normal distributions.
   1. Compute $\hat R$ to assess its convergence.
   2. Compute a posterior predictive check to assess how well the model matches the data
   3. Keep the model as it is, but now generate data coming from Gamma distributions instead of Normal distributions.  (The Gamma distribution can <i>visually</i> resemble a Normal with some choice of parameters, use those parameters) .  Assess the inference procedure with this slight change and verify how both, $\hat R$ and the posterior predictive check get spoiled.  Play with the true values to explore this interesting feature of studying the agreement of model and data while not knowing how the data has been generated.
