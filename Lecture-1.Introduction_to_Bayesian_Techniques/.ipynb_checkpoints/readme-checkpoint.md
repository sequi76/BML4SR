# Going beyond Gaussian mixtures

- Think how would you generalize for a mixture of N Gaussians
- And if instead of Gaussians you need another distribution ?  In which cases this may happen ?
- And if N is not fixed and it should also be inferred.... how would you proceed ?

# Going beyond a linear model

- Consider a linear model for a specific problem and explore it a little bit further by analyzing the approximations in it
- Let's study if we can propose a model that could model these features ans therefore reduce the impact of the approximations
